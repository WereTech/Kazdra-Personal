    "A intresting new race has been discovered, they call themselves the 'Kazdra'. In all honestly, they look like dragons almost exactly, although it is unknown if they can breath fire. Pre-analysis of their blood shows moderate acidity rather than a slightly basic pH like humans. Wouldn't reccoment touching... one of the lab techs got a pretty bad chemical burn from a sample that spilled out.",
	
	"There scales are moderately hard, but don't protect much from weapons. They seem more for heat protection rather than defense. Further analysis is needed to see if their wings can actually fly, as right now we simply don't have the tech here to test that. There technology seems to be behind most others, as at this time they only have very basic starships that were donated to them.",
	
	"A intresting note is that they have a strange attraction to crystals, being able to make weapons and clothing from them. They say some of the crystals have energy they can use to power objects, like powersuits. Some crystals were given to us for analysis. Another note is that they have a... well, let's just say 'uncontrollable' urge to hoard anything metallic or what they deem 'shiny'.",
	
	"I heard from a glitch partner that the glitch have meet this race before, and the glitch almost went to war with them because of the glitch being metallic and well... the kazdra's urge to hoard metallic objects. They still don't have good relations to this day, and probably never will at this rate. In conclusion, the 'Kazdra' race is intresting and needs further study in the future.",
