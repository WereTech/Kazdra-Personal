    "An interesting new race has been discovered, they call themselves the 'Kazdra'. They look similar to dragons but it's unknown if they can breathe fire. Pre-analysis of their blood shows moderate acidity rather than a slightly basic pH like humans. Refrain from touching... one of the lab techs got a pretty bad chemical burn from a sample that spilled out.",
	
	"Their scales are moderately hard, but doesn't protect well from weapons. They are weak and more for heat protection rather than defense. Further analysis is needed to see if their wings can actually fly, as of right now we simply don't have the tech here to test that. Their technology is more primitive than most others, as at this time they only have very basic star-ships that were donated to them.",
	
	"An interesting note is that they have a strange attraction to crystals, being able to make weapons and clothing from them. They say some of the crystals have energy they can use to power objects, like power-suits. Some crystals were given to us for analysis. Another note is that they have an 'uncontrollable urge' to hoard anything metallic or what they deem as 'shiny'.",
	
	"I heard from a Glitch partner that the Glitch have met this race before, and the Glitch almost went to war with them because the Kazdras like to hoard metallic objects, so Glitches were seen as something to hoard and obviously they didn't like it. They still don't have good relations to this day, and likely never will at this rate. In conclusion, the 'Kazdra' race is interesting and needs further study in the future.",
