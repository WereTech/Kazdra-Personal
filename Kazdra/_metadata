It's a little ramshackle and pasted together, but it works with 1.3 perfectly now.\n\nBackstory: The Kazdra come of a planet weak with metals, so they used crystals instead. Metals were only to be used very rarely. As their planet's small supply of metal ran out, they used what was left and took to the stars, searching for a new place to call home.\n\nComing soon:\n> [strike]Codex entries for backstory and lore[/strike] Basic version of this is in place! \n> Fancy new armors and weapons (once i learn how to sprite correctly lol)!\n> Maybe some mech parts!\n> Some other surprises ;)\n\nFeedback is more than welcome! Let me know what you think!\n\n0.1.2 \"Fall Cleaning\" update:\n> Added a codex in that gives some basic info and backstory about the race\n> Updated the way races speak to Kazdra\n   -Glitch: Very Hostile! Like, VERY.\n   -Human: Friendly, maybe a little TOO friendly...\n   -Florian: Scared, they don't like fire lizards\n> Found some neat Mask texture hidden in the files and re-activated them\n   -Ghastly Mask: Spawned with ItemId \"kazghastlyhead\"\n   -Blue Mask: Spawned with ItemId \"kazbluemask\"\n   (both are craftable at a spinning wheel for the moment, though starbound decided to break... gonna try and fix it)\n> Cleaned up the \"\\items\\armors\\kazdra\" folder\n> Changed the name of some of the blocks/fixed descriptions\n> Removed the \"test\" armor set and all mentions of it\n\n0.1.21 update:\n[KB-003] Fixed the Recipe file Exception errors\n[KB-004] Fixed converse.config.patch error caused by a missing Comma\n\n0.1.23 update:\n[KB-005] Fixed infinite teleporting bug by renaming the ship files correctly (WARNING! THIS WILL MAKE ALL OLD CHARACTERS UNPLAYABLE!)\n(undocumented) Started to change recipies from pixels to actual ones\n\n0.1.25 update:\n[KB-006] Removed the dungeon causing the issues on world generation\n\n0.1.27 update:\nAttempted to fix world gen issue by removing any mentionings of dungeon in any files.\nIF THIS DOESN'T WORK, DELETE YOUR UNIVERSE AND TERRESTRIAL_PLANETS FILE!",
